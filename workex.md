### Research Intern at Biorobotics Laboratory, Robotics Institute, CMU (Mentor: Prof. Howie Choset)
- Project Title: “3D Point Cloud Registration using Deep Learning techniques.”
- Designed a Novel, Correspondence-Matrix based Loss Function to align a pair of 3D Point Clouds.
- Achieved a Significant (40%) Improvement in Rotation Error by integrating our method with recent networks.

### Research Intern at LIGM Laboratory, ESIEE Paris (Mentor: Prof. Laurent NAJMAN)
- Honored to receive the prestigious CHARPAK Scholarship by the French Government to fund this research.  
- Project Title: “Learning Representation using Mathematical Morphology.” 
- Analysed Watershed Cuts, a Graph-based Segmentation approach, for Semi-Supervised Classification.
- Integrated Deep Learning Models with Classical Watershed Cuts to Improve (~5%) the Classification Results.

### Student Researcher at Computer Vision Laboratory, IIT Madras (Mentor: Prof. Anurag Mittal)
- Project Title: “3D Object Classification & Semantic Segmentation using Point Clouds.” 
- Proposed a Novel Deep Learning Architecture to represent the Unstructured Nature of 3D Point Clouds. 
- Achieved State-of-the-Art results on two Challenging Datasets for Classification & Part-Segmentation tasks.

### Undergraduate Research, Aerospace Department, IIT Madras (Mentor: Prof. Nagabhushana Rao Vadlamani)
- Project Title: “Deep Learning based RANS Method for Turbulence Modeling.”
- Developed a Tensor Basis Neural Network model to predict the Reynolds Stress Tensor for Turbulent Flows.
- Achieved a 2.8% RMSE between True & Predicted Values across Flows with different Reynolds Numbers.
