## Carnegie Mellon University - Robotics Institute, PA, USA

### Apple Device Recycling Project - R&D Intern - Biorobotics Lab
- Collaborated with Apple Inc. to revolutionize its recycling robots, Daisy and Dave, using Machine Learning. The two key tasks included intraclass iPhone Classification & disassembly of end-of-life iPhones.
- Designed a novel Multimodal Attentional CNN (iCAM) to classify iPhones from images & X-Ray scans, achieving 99.9% classification accuracy for 6 iPhone classes & improving by 14% over the state-of-the-art.
- Equipped Image Registration methods (Superglue & Demons) to find component deformation to aid disassembly.

### Point Cloud Registration Project - Research Intern - Biorobotics Lab | [link] 	May 2020-Aug 2021
- Designed a novel Correspondence based Loss Function for the 3D Registration task, achieving a decrease of 40% in Rotation Error over the state-of-the-art loss functions.
- Formulated an outlier filtering approach that can filter out 99% of the outlier points accurately, achieving an 80% decrease in Registration Error compared to no outlier filtering.
- Published at IEEE International Conference on 3D Vision (3DV) [link], Fukuoka, Japan, 2020, pp. 603-612.

### Autonomous Driving (AD) Simulator Project - R&D Intern - RPAD Lab | [link]	   May 2021-Aug 2021
- Programmable Light Curtains have potential to replace the LiDAR sensor, cutting the AD costs by upto 80,000$.
- Designed a Light Curtain simulator & integrated it with an AD agent achieving a 7.2% increase in driving score.

## ESIEE Paris
### Research Intern at LIGM Laboratory, ESIEE Paris (Mentor: Prof. Laurent NAJMAN)
- Honored to receive the prestigious CHARPAK Scholarship by the French Government to fund this research.  
- Project Title: “Learning Representation using Mathematical Morphology.” 
- Analysed Watershed Cuts, a Graph-based Segmentation approach, for Semi-Supervised Classification.
- Integrated Deep Learning Models with Classical Watershed Cuts to Improve (~5%) the Classification Results.

## Indian Institute of Technology Madras, Chennai, India

### 3D Semantic Segmentation Project - Student Researcher - Computer Vision Lab | [link]   	 Nov 2019-May 2020
- Proposed a novel Deep Learning Architecture to model the Unstructured Nature of 3D Point Clouds.
- Achieved State-of-the-Art accuracy (93.9%) on ModelNet40 Classification task (0.5% improvement) & 60.6% mIoU on Part-Net Segmentation task (0.8% improvement).
