### American Express Ignite 2019 (Competition hosted by AmEx)

- Project Title: “ ​ Cricket Physics and Analytics” (​ mentored by ​ Madhan RA, Director, American Express​ )   
- To predict the Win Probability of a Match in between the Match given the Ball-by-Ball Statistics. 
- Building Confidence Interval for Win Probability on the top of the LSTM Model. 


### Netflix Data Challenge (Kaggle Data Contest) 

- Data Contest hosted on Kaggle to predict User based Movie Ratings using different Models and their Ensembles. 
- Models include Neighborhood Model, Latent Factor Model, Repeated Matrix Reconstruction and other 
Regressors.
