I am a Senior Undergrad student pursuing a Bachelors+Masters Dual Degree Program at IIT Madras, India. My Bachelors major is in Aerospace Engineering and Masters major is in Data Science.

My broad research interest lies in the fields of Deep Learning and Computer Vision. To be more specific, in the domain of 3D Point Clouds and 3D Deep Learning. The Point Cloud obtained from the LiDAR sensor is one of the most crucial component of self-driven cars to achieve Level 4 & Level 5 autonomy.
